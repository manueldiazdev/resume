% Author : Jayesh Sanwal
% Reach out to me on LinkedIn(/in/jsanwal), with any suggestions, ideas, etc.
%------------------------

%%-------------------------------------
% Author Notes here -
% 1) Change " Author+an = {N=highlight}" in "Publications.bib", where N is the number at which your name appears
% 2) Use "\vspace" wisely, that would change spacing, and is currently being used as a hacky fix
% 3) Do not delete the fonts in the left side
% 4) Use the "Rich Text" feature on Overleaf - On the top panel next to source. Makes it much easier for starters on LaTeX to use this template
% 5) Do NOT use periods at the end of bullet points, the sample (ipsum) text might have it
% 6) Use "maxbibnames" on this file to change the maximum number of authors on the paper (Credits: Dr. Natasha Krell) - Default is 3, but change line 92 to add authors

%%-------------------------------------
% Changes from last version -
% 1) Removed areas of Expertise as a separate section - integrated into the summary section
% 2) Changed Focus to Academic Projects instead of Education
% 3) Made the integrated summary 3 lines over 1
% 4) Changed spacing between sections and bullets
% 5) Changed the number of authors to be user customized

%%-------------------------------------
% Changes to be made here -
% 1) Shift to Class file, make changes here
% 2) Use a fonts folder
% 3) Incorporate Leadership & volunteering together
% 4) Remove \vspace based 'hacky' fixes
